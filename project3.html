  <p> One place I have truly been dreaming of visiting is Tokyo Japan for the world baseball classic. Not only will I be visiting another 
  country, culture, and social system, I  will be watching baseball of another country. The world baseball classic is essentially the 
  "World Cup" of baseball. Teams from all over the globe compete till there is simply one left standing, and it has been my life long
  dream to attend this tremendous event.  
  
  <!--Comments The World Baseball Classic finals are in Los Angleles for 2017-->
  
  <h2> A person I admire

  <br> 
  (past or present)</h2>
  
  <p> I admire Clayton Kershaw. He is the Ace pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and a big time Christian. Clayton prays before every 
  start during his pre-game warmups. He is my idol. I have seen many of his games, including some public speaking of baseball and 
  Christianity.
